This reposetory exsist only for ease of acess to the web scraped data for my Homework. I have included the web scraping code for better transparency as well. The main file of intrest is the Determine_new_categories.py The file scrapes book descriptiones from books.to.scrape.com and then googles the title and description and adds kindle amazon to enshure the first resoult is amazon. From there it clicks the first link and extracts the ful hierarcy of categories provided by amazon. Some book titles are short and share the same name with other books this is the reson the search includes the book description in addition to the title.

IMPORTANT
the Determine_new_categories.py file dose not include code to handle cookies. Afters scraping books.to.scrape.com the user has to maualy click on googles cookie pop up (accept all or reject all). Additionaly the output of this file may variy due to capcha blocking the driver from accesing the book data. Furthermore bolth Determine_new_categories.py and scrape_book_data.py require chromedriver.exe in the same repository. It is possible to modefy the path by changing the value of executable_path  to your path.
