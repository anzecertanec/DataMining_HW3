This repository exists only for ease of access to the web-scraped data for my homework. I have included the web scraping code for better transparency as well. The main file of interest is the Determine_new_categories.py. This file scrapes book descriptions from books.toscrape.com and then googles the title and description, adding "kindle amazon" to ensure the first result is Amazon. From there, it clicks the first link and extracts the full hierarchy of categories provided by Amazon. Some book titles are short and share the same name with other books; this is the reason the search includes the book description in addition to the title.

IMPORTANT:
The Determine_new_categories.py file does not include code to handle cookies. After scraping books.toscrape.com, the user has to manually click on Googleâ€™s cookie pop-up (accept all or reject all). Additionally, the output of this file may vary due to CAPTCHA blocking the driver from accessing the book data. Furthermore, both Determine_new_categories.py and scrape_book_data.py require chromedriver.exe in the same repository. It is possible to modify the path by changing the value of executable_path to your path.

Determine_new_categories.py has a very long runtime (about 40 minutes). This is mainly due to the many wait lines implemented in the code to combat my slow internet speed. The waits can be adjusted if you are working with a faster connection.
